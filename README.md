# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this challenge was to create a visual aide about cryptocurrency.  

First I prepped the data

Sencond I reduced the data dimensions using PCA

Next I created an Elbow Curve

Following that, I created a 3D-Scatter with Clusters

From there, I created a tradable crypto table

Finally, I created a scatter hvplot

### In Conclusion

This challenge was not without its obstacles.  Currently my biggest challenge is getting jupyter notebook to load.  At this time I am installing everytime I need to use it.  Once I was able to hvplot to download the programs worked great.  All in all this was a fun exercise.
